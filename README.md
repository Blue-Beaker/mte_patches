# MTE Patches
Fixes bugs in mods for the modpack Minetech:Evolution.  

## Current fixes:  
### Railcraft
__Multiblock Desync__  
  Fixes a desync bug of multiblock that client doesn't load them properly when the multiblock is across chunks,  
  and the chunks are not loaded by the client at the same time.  
  When desync, client can get its inventory scrambled when right-clicked at the bugged multiblock.  
  
__Free Turbine Repair__  
  Fixes turbine being fixed for free when putting in crafting slot with a blade and take it out.
